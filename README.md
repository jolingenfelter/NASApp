# NASApp

An app that makes calls to the NASA API to fetch and display images from the Mars Rover, the Astronomy Image of the Day, and satellite images for a searched location.  The user can select images from the Mars Rover and add text to make a digital postcard, which can be saved to the device or shared from within the App.  Note that since this app was originally created, the NASA API has been updated and calls are no longer consistently fetching sattelite images of Earth.  This app uses CoreLocation and Mapkit for handling location.
