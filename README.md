# NASApp

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build an iOS app in Swift using the the NASA API. You need to implement two required features, and an optional one. We expect you to use different skills in different ways and encourage you to go above and beyond the requirements stated in terms of usage of APIs and iOS capabilities. This is the opportunity to make a really nice portfolio piece, and we hope you make it your own! While mockups are provided, they represent just one of the many possible ways the finished app could look. We hope you will get creative and base your layouts and design on the particular functionalities of your app.

Rover Postcard Maker: Access the Mars Rover Imagery API and display a selected, filtered, or randomized image from the Mars Rover.

Eye-In-the-Sky: Build a tool to access the Earth Imagery API and display a photo of a user specified area.

Optional Custom Feature: Create your own app feature using the NASA API! Get creative and showcase everything that you are able to do!
